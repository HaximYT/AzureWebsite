First of all, you need to download nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/) and yarn https://yarnpkg.com/
then create a terminal in vscode and navigate to the directory or press open folder and then 
navigate to this folder and type 'yarn'. This will install the node modules required and update them.
Then you write 'yarn start' in the terminal and wait a minute; this will load up the website locally.

Then you can transpile it with webpack to convert it into a static website or you can just copy and 
paste the code from the local website and make it into a html website

Sorry this took so long because I had other projects to do and IRL issues. Anyways, enjoy (fully
SEO - in the public -> index.html file). 

Just make sure to keep the footer and give me credits since you got a free website pls  : (
